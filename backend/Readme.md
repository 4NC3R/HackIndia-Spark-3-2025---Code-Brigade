A short description of the backend.

üëâThese are the following routes that are being used for the Project:

‚≠ê `/upload_image`

‚ñ∂Ô∏è The `upload_iamge` route handles the operation of taking an image from the user on the front end.


‚≠ê `/perform-ocr`

‚ñ∂Ô∏è The `/perform_ocr` will perform the operation of Optical Character Recognition on the provided image and display a summary of the text present in the image. 

‚ñ∂Ô∏è We will be implementing the Mistral model for OCR on the image.


‚≠ê `/ragchat`

‚ñ∂Ô∏è The `/ragchat` route will handle the RAG system that will enable the user to ask questions based on the documents or directories that are uploaded at the frontend. 

‚ñ∂Ô∏è The Large Language Model that is used in the `ragchat/app.py` file is the Cohere Aya Expanse 8 billion model.


‚≠ê `/summarise`

‚ñ∂Ô∏è The above route is mainly to create a summary of a large section of document that is provided by the user.

‚ñ∂Ô∏è We have implemented the Aya Expanse model consisting of 32 billion parameters to handle summarisation.

‚ñ∂Ô∏è Along with summarisation, since the Aya Model family consists of multi-lingual support, we have also included a feature that is able to handle the translation of text from a base language to a target language.
