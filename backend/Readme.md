A short description of the backend.

These are the following routes that are being used for the Project:

- `/upload_image`

The `upload_iamge` route handles the operation of taking an image from the user on the front end.

- `/perform-ocr`

The `/perform_ocr` will perform the operation of Optical Character Recognition on the provided image and display a summary of the text present in the image. 
We will be implementing the Mistral model for OCR on the image.

- `/ragchat`

The `/ragchat` route will handle the RAG system that will enable the user to ask questions based on the documents or directories that are uploaded at the frontend. 
The Large Language Model that is used in the `ragchat/app.py` file is the Cohere Aya Expanse 8 billion model.

- `/summarise`

The above route is mainly to create a summary of a large section of document that is provided by the user.
We have implemented the Aya Expanse model consisting of 32 billion parameters to handle summarisation.
Along with summarisation, since the Aya Model family consists of multi-lingual support, we have also included a feature that is able to handle the translation of text from a base language to a target language.
